# reactjs-boilerplate
ReactJS boilerplate without 'Create React App'

# Usage
Clone the repo into a folder (The repo must stay on your drive as long as you use the boilerplate)
``` 
$ git clone https://github.com/ismailgunayy/reactjs-boilerplate
$ cd reactjs-boilerplate
$ npm install
$ npm link
```

Then you can use the boilerplate by typing `react-bp {folder-name}`
 

### Disclaimer
I created this boilerplate based on [this article](https://dev.to/nikhilkumaran/don-t-use-create-react-app-how-you-can-set-up-your-own-reactjs-boilerplate-43l0) and I update the repo as I need improvements.
